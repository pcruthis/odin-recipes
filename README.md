# My First Project
This is a quick and easy recipe webpage utilizing basic HTML commands. This is my first project completed while learning HTML, as well as my first time utilizing git and the README.md file.

## How It's Made:

As of now, this project is solely HTML. The main goal of this first project was to familiarize myself with creating different headings, adding links and pictures, utilizing both ordered and unordered lists, and perfecting the HTML boilerplate. 

## Lessons Learned:
The biggest issue I had during this project was correctly linking my own local files. I am trying to create new directories and files using only my linux terminal, and I can get a little lost in the file path at times. It can be frustrating with something doesn't work properly, but I learned far more from making mistakes than if everything had gone perfectly on the first try.
